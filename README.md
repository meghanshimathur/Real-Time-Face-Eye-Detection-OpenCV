# 👁️ Real-Time Face & Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project implements a **real-time face and eye detection system** using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers.  
The system captures live video from a webcam, detects faces and eyes, and displays bounding boxes in real time.

It demonstrates classical computer vision techniques widely used in facial recognition pipelines.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Webcam captures live frames.
2. Frames are converted to grayscale.
3. Haar Cascade detects frontal faces.
4. Eye detection runs inside face regions.
5. Rectangles are drawn around faces (blue) and eyes (green).
6. Press **Q** to exit.
